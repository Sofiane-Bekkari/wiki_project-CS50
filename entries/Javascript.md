# JavaScript

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where [HTML](/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](/wiki/CSS) are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
